   <p>A sedan or saloon (British English)[1][2] is a passenger car in a three-box configuration with separate compartments for an engine, passengers, and cargo.[3] The first recorded use of sedan in reference to an automobile body occurred in 1912.[4] The name derives from the 17th-century litter known as a sedan chair, a one-person enclosed box with windows and carried by porters. Variations of the sedan style include the close-coupled sedan, club sedan, convertible sedan, fastback sedan, hardtop sedan, notchback sedan, and sedanet/sedanette.</p>

    <h3>Standard styles:</h3>
    <p>
        Notchback sedans
Main article: Notchback
In the United States, the notchback sedan distinguishes models with a horizontal trunk lid. The term is generally only referred to in marketing when it is necessary to distinguish between two sedan body styles (e.g. notchback and fastback) of the same model range.

    Liftback sedans
Main article: Liftback
Several sedans have a fastback profile, but have a hatchback-style tailgate which is hinged at the roof. Examples include the Peugeot 309, Škoda Octavia, Hyundai Elantra XD, Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, BMW 4 Series Grand Coupe, Audi A5 Sportback, and Tesla Model S. The names hatchback and sedan are often used to differentiate between body styles of the same model. To avoid confusion, the term hatchback sedan is not often used.

    <h3>Mid-20th century variations:</h3>
    <p>Close-coupled sedans
        A close-coupled sedan is a body style produced in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Their two-box boxy styling made these sedans more like crossover vehicles than traditional three-box sedans. Like other close-coupled body styles, the rear seats are located further forward than a regular sedan.[7]: 43 [34] This reduced the length of the body; close-coupled sedans, also known as town sedans, were the shortest of the sedan models offered.</p>

        <h3>Sedanets:</h3>   
     <p>
        From the 1910s to the 1950s, several United States manufacturers have named models either Sedanet or Sedanette. The term originated as a smaller version of the sedan;[42] however, it has also been used for convertibles and fastback coupes. Models that have been called Sedanet or Sedanette include the 1917 Dort Sedanet,[43] King,[42] 1919 Lexington,[42] 1930s Cadillac Fleetwood Sedanette,[44] 1949 Cadillac Series 62 Sedanette,[45] 1942-1951 Buick Super Sedanet,[46][47] and 1956 Studebaker.
